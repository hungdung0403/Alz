This is the translation of the paragraph into English with correct grammar:

Education is currently a social concern, in the modern world that is increasingly developing, the quality of education can be affected by many factors, both subjective and objective, of students. This report studies the impact of demographic factors of students on their scores. From the results obtained, I hope to be able to help improve the quality of education.
In this report, I will study the factors that affect the final score of Portuguese language (the third exam - variable G3) of students at two high schools. The reason I chose the data set on Portuguese language scores is because it has more observations than the data set on final math scores.
